## Description

Refactoring html of the website to improve readability and accessibility by changing generic to semantic html.

I learned how to optmize code for better performance, improve accessibility, and how to use new tools and techniques to solve problems.

## Installation

The first step is to install the Visual Studio Code on your local system. Then install the extention "Open in browser" to open the html file. Clone the repository and commit and push changes.

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
