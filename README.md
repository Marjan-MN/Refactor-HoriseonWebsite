## Description

Refactoring html and css of the website to improve readability and accessibility by changing generic to semantic html.

I learned how to optmize code for better performance, improve accessibility, and how to use new tools and techniques to solve problems. 



## Installation

The first step is to install the Visual Studio Code on your local system. Then install the extention "Open in browser" to open the html file. Clone the repository and commit and push changes.


## Mock-Up
